            <h1>All about Petteia</h1>
        <section id="mainText">
            <p>Petteia, or πεττεια, is an Ancient Greek strategic board game that involved moving pieces around a board and attempting to surround the opponent's pieces.</p>
            <h2>Ancient Chess</h2>
            <p>It has historical significance with chess e.g. according to Averbach, “there is an underlying Greek influence [with games like Petteia with chess] mainly with two points: the introduction of a war board-game and the absence of the luck [-dice] element.” </p>
            <p>Myron Samsin, 2002, had examined the way of capture in the ancient board game of Greek Petteia.  Taking into account some sources, he concludes in Petteia influences the capturing in these games was the one we know for the Tafl game (a popularised Viking Game known for influencing 4 player chess) as well as many others- a piece is removed if it's surrounded on its two opposite sides by the opponent's pieces. The game is also very similar to the Egypt game Siga (or Seega). After the Greek cultural influence over Ancient Rome also had its echoes on Latrunculi. I found on the net also these names of related games: Tau, Pente Grammai, Nard, Shantaram, Fitchneal, Tawlbyund, and Alea Evangel.

Many ancient Greek texts refer to Petteia, including Homer’s Odyssey: “οἱ μὲν ἔπειτα πεσσοῖσι προπάροιθε θυράων…” In this case, πεσσοῖσι refers to the stones or pebbles used to play the game. An actual reference to the word πεττεια is in Athenaeus’ Deipnosophistae in the 3rd century AD: “...οὐ παρὰ τοῦ μεγάλου Διοδώρου ἢ Θεοδώρου μαθόντες τὴν πεττείαν…” (...not having learnt the piece-game [petteia] from Diodorus the great or from Theodorus…). There are also hints that the game originated in ancient Egypt, according to Plato: “...εὑρεῖν… ἔτι δὲ πεττείας…” (...he [Naucratis of Egypt] … also invented piece-games [Petteia]...). Since there was not much information on the game, this website presents an adaptation of what the game could have entailed, however the ideas of horizontal and vertical movement and capturing by surrounding pieces was definitely involved. Some sources involve five rows and columns, such as Hesychius of Alexandria’s Lexicon: “καὶ πεσσὰ πεντέγραμμα” (five-lined stones).
